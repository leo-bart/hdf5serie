/** \mainpage HDF5Serie - A HDF5 Wrapper for Time Series - API Documentation
 *
 * \section purpse Purpose of this Project
 *
 * This project has the purpose to provide a template based high level C++
 * interface/wrapper to HDF5 (http://www.hdfgroup.org) especially/just for
 * reading and writing series of data. It provides a simple interface to
 * append data to an existing HDF5-Dataset with one unlimited dimension.
 * The data to append can be vectors/matrices of elementary type or structs.
 * The use of the HDF5 DataType and DataSpace is totally encapsulated by the
 * templates structure of this project (of course only for the provided
 * functionality).
 *
 * \section install Download/Installation
 *
 * The source code of this project is only avaliable via svn. See
 * http://code.google.com/p/openmbv for more informations.
 *
 * For installation instructions see the README file of the "checkout" from svn.
